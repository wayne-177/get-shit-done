Task 2 of plan 01-02 completed successfully

Modified: /Users/macuser/.claude/hooks/gsd-statusline.js
Changes:
- Added scaling formula: (rawUsed / 80) * 100 to show 100% at 80% real usage
- Renamed 'used' to 'rawUsed' for raw percentage calculation
- Applied Math.min(100, ...) to cap displayed percentage at 100%
- Updated color thresholds: 63%, 81%, 95% (adjusted from 50%, 65%, 80%)
- Added comments explaining scaling rationale and real percentage equivalents

Verification:
✓ rawUsed variable exists with raw percentage calculation
✓ used variable applies scaling formula (rawUsed / 80) * 100
✓ Math.min(100, ...) caps the result
✓ Color thresholds are 63, 81, 95
✓ Comments reference "~50% real", "~65% real", "~76% real"
✓ Test 80% real → 100% displayed (red with skull)
✓ Test 20% real → 25% displayed (green)
✓ Test 50% real → 63% displayed (yellow boundary)
