# GSD State

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-01 — Milestone v1.1 started

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** User decisions from discuss-phase must reach all downstream agents and be respected
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 — Upstream Port & Autonomy Fixes

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
- 3-phase approach: critical upstream ports → autonomy fixes → git branching
- Research at `.planning/research/` covers changelog, diffs, portability, methodology, autonomy audit
- Zero conflicts expected between upstream changes and our custom additions

### Blockers
- Git branching execution location unknown (config exists in settings.md but consumption point TBD)
- Squash merge feature may not be implemented upstream (files identical)
