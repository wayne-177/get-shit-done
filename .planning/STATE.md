## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- 3-phase approach: critical upstream ports -> autonomy fixes -> git branching
- Research at `.planning/research/` covers changelog, diffs, portability, methodology, autonomy audit
- Zero conflicts expected between upstream changes and our custom additions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Git branching execution location unknown (config exists in settings.md but consumption point TBD)
